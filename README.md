# Food Wizard

A full stack JavaScript web application for people who want to find, create, critique, and share recipes!

## Latest Update

24-08-2024

I have completed updating the 3rd Party API fetch requests and have decided to archive this application. I'll be starting a new full-stack Food Wizard application from scratch using a new tech stack. I will be implimenting TypeScript, React Router, and Mantine UI!

Thank you to everyone who has helped me build this. I've realized that a simple refactor is out of the question, I've committed a lot of this applications responsiveness to... window hashing. I may refactor this projects code in the future as practice, but I do not plan to add any features.

## Why I built this

As a former chef, I wanted to build an application that provided straight forward recipes. Commenting on recipes allows users to share recipe modification successes and failures. This will provide immediate recipe feedback for the user to utilize in their decision to use the recipe!

## Development

### Clone the Repository

#### LearningFuze vscode

1. Copy the link below
  ```bash
  git@github.com:OSAdams/food-wizard.git
  ```
2. Clone the repository by clicking the blue icon on the bottem left of your vscode
3. Click "**Clone Repository in Container Volume**"
4. Paste the link you have just copied and hit enter!

#### GitBash

1. Open your GitBash terminal
2. Copy the *HTTPS* code below
```bash
https://github.com/OSAdams/food-wizard.git
```
3. In your terminal, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSAdams/food-wizard.git
cd food-wizard
```

### Run and test project setup

#### Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies with NPM
```bash
npm install
```

#### Create the database

1. Start PostgreSQL server
```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```
2. Create database
```bash
createdb foodWizard
```
3. Start the database
```bash
pgweb --db=foodWizard
```
4. Copy the `.env.example` file and name it to `.env`
5. Open the `.env` file and update the `TOKEN_SECRET` to any 20 character string value. This is used to hash the users password in our database. Upper case, lower case, and numbers only.
6. When you obtain your Spoonacular API key, update the `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` value in the `.env` file with your own Spoonacular API key.

#### Start the development servers

1. Open your `Procfile` and copy/paste the line below *above* `web: npm start`
    - This command clears the database, you can remove it in the future
```bash
release: npm run prod:db:import
```
2. In a seperate terminal, start all the development servers with the `"dev"` scripts
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Later, when you wish to stop the development servers, type `Ctrl-C` in the terminal where theservers are running.
4. To turn off your postgresql server, copy and paste the command below in your terminal
```bash
sudo service postgresql stop
```

#### Verify the client

1. A React app has already been created for you
2. Take a minute to look over the code in `client/components/app.jsx` to get an idea of what it is doing.
3. Go to your app in your browers, you should see the home page!

#### Set up the database

1. In a seperate terminal, run `npm run db:import` to create your tables
2. At this point your database is setup and you are good to start using it. However there is no data in your database, which isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. All you need to do is register an account using the sign-up feature!
